			<big>What is MrSilveryGibbon.com?</big>
			</br>
			<p>MrSilveryGibbon.com is a self developed side project intended to act as a vector through which I can develop my experience as a web developer among other skills. This website should also serve as a blog for general use. This project began during my isolation as a result of COVID-19. Through an abundance of free time, I decided it a good idea to teach myself HTML/JS and cloud hosting as a passion project and general experience. This project has not only expanded my skillset but also taken my mind off of various personal issues at the time.</p>
			<p>Armed with nothing more than rudimentary VIM skills and a decent knowledge of other languages, I undertook the task of learning HTML in under 50 minutes. Despite the daunting nature of this task, I came to quickly undersand and appreciate the simple yet powerful nature of this language. There is something about HTML that just feel cozy and welcoming, almost like a fireplace in winter.</p>
			<p>Alas, with this project under my belt, I am confident in my ability to continually develop my skills and complete a task from start to finish without giving up, despite the many hardships faced over the course of this project.</p>
			<p>Yours Truly, </p>
